# 📋 Full-Stack Task Manager (MERN Architecture)

A robust, full-stack Task Management application built to demonstrate the integration between a modern Frontend and a Node.js REST API.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (for modern UI), JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **API Protocol:** RESTful API
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, and Delete tasks in real-time.
* **RESTful Architecture:** Clear separation between Client and Server logic.
* **Responsive UI:** Designed with Tailwind CSS to work on both Desktop and Mobile.
* **CORS Enabled:** Secure cross-origin resource sharing between different ports.

## 🏗 System Architecture
This project follows a standard **Client-Server Architecture**. The Frontend makes asynchronous requests using the Fetch API to the Node.js backend, which processes the data and sends back JSON responses.
